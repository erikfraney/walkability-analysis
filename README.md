# walkability-analysis
Identifying the factors that contribute to walkability in U.S. cities through machine learning. Recoding MBA project from SAS to Python.

The U.S. has long been known as a car-centric country, where most (if not all) daily errands require using a car. In recent years there has been mindset shift away from that, moving towards creating walkable cities. Improving walkability in our cities and towns has many benefits, including: improving transportation efficiency, reducing traffic, reducing Carbon emissions, reducing pedestrian and motor vehicle injuries/fatalities, improving health, and improving livability in general. This analysis uses national data (EPA’s Smart Location Database and the EPA's National Walkability Index) to learn what impacts an area’s “walkability” the most. Understanding which factors contribute to walkability the most will give a blueprint to local municipalities and planning departments when implementing measures to improve their cities.
